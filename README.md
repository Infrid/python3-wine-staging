# Build your python 3 applications for windows using wine
I need to build windows binaries for few python3 tools, this image
creates the environment with wine and pyinstaller, no need to use a
windows license and/or run it natively. Thanks to the fine folks
working on the wine project.

![Some cool illustration](https://github.com/Infrid/python3-wine-staging/raw/main/boa-constrictor.jpg)

## Getting Started
The image is very big, about 3GB! The python distribution is installed
under C:\Python3 with pyinstaller.

### Prerequisites
In order to run this container you'll need Docker installed but should
work just fine on podman.
